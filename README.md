# TODO
- instead of making #eye display: none; when in #filter maybe just make #filter z-index: 100; same as #eye?
- prevent blink from firing when dragging #filter-output-gang it looks odd
- clicking out of #filter-output close it 
# BUGS
- dragging #filter-output-gang when returning to drag area and its on a element that element is selected... don't want that!
- dragging to the end of the #filter-output area causes scroll to go in that direction instead of the intended opposite direction! 

# Future
# Purpose
