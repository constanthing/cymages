# TODO
- instead of making #eye display: none; when in #filter maybe just make #filter z-index: 100; same as #eye?
- prevent blink from firing when dragging #filter-output-gang it looks odd
- clicking out of #filter-output close it 
- Add cool image altering,shaping,molding, etc. effect when hovering over them that follows the cursor? (maybe too much idk just an idea)
- add dragging functionality too #images 
# BUGS
- dragging #filter-output-gang when returning to drag area and its on a element that element is selected... don't want that!
    - does it on safari not google chrome
- dragging to the end of the #filter-output area causes scroll to go in that direction instead of the intended opposite direction! 

# Future
- appropriate solution to adjusting #gallery-dimmer height to gallery height including scroll height not just visible height (implementation in js but doesn't resize)
# Purpose
Help me understand how to deal with images/videos better... and I also like to take pictures in cyberpunk. 
# Learned
[optimization](FUTURE LINK)
